# Load 'panels'. Up to 26 panels can be loaded.
# They can be referenced using A-Z
# Specify normal, neon and screen, or 'none'
# Panel format
# panel {norm} {neon} {scrn}
# {norm}, {neon}, and {scrn} are paths which point to the normal, neon, and screen graphics for a panel. {neon} and {scrn} are optional fields. If you aren't using them, put the word 'none' in their place.
# Normal mode panel layers are just plain images. They have no visual effects.
# Neon mode panel layers use 'pallete cycling': certain colors slowy change to different colors. To be more specific, colors 128 through 135 in the pallete will be cycled by two steps three times each second.
# Screen mode panel layers have alpha transparency. That means, they blend with the colors behind them, darker colors are more transparent, and brighter colors will blend less.

## Spawning Area ##
# Spawn format:
#
#	spawn	[id]
#	alias	[name]		(change the displayed name, optional)
#	map	[num]		(colourmap, range 0-3, optional)
#	health	[num]		(optional)
#	item	[id]		(obstacles only: contained item, optional)
#	boss	[0/1]		(see below, optional)
#	flip	[0/1]		(0 = face left, 1 = face right, optional)
#	coords	[num] [num]	(coords relative to scrollpos)
#	at	[scrollpos]
#
# Also:
#	wait			(blocks scrolling until all enemies defeated)
#	at	[scrollpos]
#
# And:
#	group	[min] [max]	(set minimum and maximum enemies, see below)
#	at	[scrollpos]
#
#
#
# Using group, you may set two values, namely:
#
# [min]
# If the number of enemies drops below [min], more enemies will be spawned
# (if possible).
#
# [max]
# No more than [max] enemies will be present.
#
# So, to make enemies appear in groups of four, use this:
# group 1 4
#
# To make them appear normally, use this:
# group 4 4
